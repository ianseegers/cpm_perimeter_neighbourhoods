**README**

Hello! Welcome to this repository.

Here, I have stored all code, scripts, figures, etc. involved in my master's thesis 
titled _"Empirical parameter scaling helps detect discretization artefacts in cellular Potts models"_.
Additionally, some simulations (in HTML format) are available to see the figures "in motion".

In order for everything to work, make sure that you have downloaded Artistoo: https://github.com/ingewortel/artistoo
For tips on how to get started with the software, see https://artistoo.net/manual/getting-started.html
All paths are written in such a way that the artistoo folder is expected to be in the same parent directory as this repository.
Should errors occur, please first verify that this is the case.

In case of errors, questions, or inquiries feel free to contact me at ian.seegers@ru.nl
